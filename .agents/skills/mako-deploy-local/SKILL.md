# Deploy MAKO locally

This workflow updates the installed MAKO Decky development instance and replaces the native 64-bit MAKO Renderer. Announce that local deployment is starting. Games using MAKO must be closed before the Renderer is replaced; stop if there is evidence that one is still running.

Execution boundary: build, installation, and reload run directly on the SteamOS host. This workflow does not start Docker or Podman; Codex's isolated command shell is not the SteamOS host.

## Workflow

1. Locate the MAKO repository root and confirm it contains `AGENTS.md`, `plugin/package.json`, and `plugin/scripts/deploy-dev.sh`. Read the current `AGENTS.md` and the **Direct SteamOS iteration** section of `plugin/docs/PACKAGING.md`; they remain authoritative if this skill becomes stale.
2. Inspect the branch and worktree and preserve all user changes. Check running games, the build toolchain, and X11/XCB headers on the actual SteamOS host, not inside Codex's default isolated command environment. The Renderer builder fetches the shared Vulkan-Headers pin into its local cache and enforces the package header check. In Codex, use host execution (`exec_command` with `sandbox_permissions: "require_escalated"`) for the process check and deployment. A sandbox process list cannot establish that host games are closed, and Pacman can report a header package installed after a SteamOS image update even when its files are missing. The plugin must already be installed in Decky; let the deployment script fail closed if the configured installation cannot be found.
3. For a local Decky plus 64-bit Renderer deploy, run this from the repository root:

    ```bash
    pnpm --dir plugin run dev:all --reload
    ```

    This incrementally builds and deploys the Decky frontend, Python backend, and native 64-bit Renderer, refreshes development identity, and reloads MAKO Decky. It does not build the 32-bit Renderer, Qt UI archive, or Flatpak bundles. Do not expand the deployment scope based on the changed files; use a different command only when the user explicitly requests that scope. If a host prerequisite is missing, use the SteamOS build-tool installer linked from `plugin/docs/PACKAGING.md`; do not infer host availability from the sandbox or silently switch to a container/package build.

4. Require the command's verified active-library hashes for every requested native architecture and a successful reload before declaring the build ready to test. `deploy-dev.sh` resolves the selected Decky or default standalone owner, checks private/public Frame Generation manifest agreement, and verifies the selected Frame Generation, spatial scaling, and vkBasalt libraries against the build. Checking only Decky's private library or development metadata is insufficient because that copy can be inactive. Treat selection or hash failures as failed deployment; use the owning script to fix them rather than hand-editing installed manifests. Report exactly which scopes and active owner were deployed and whether reload succeeded. If the script says a protected Decky manifest was retained, surface that warning rather than replacing it manually.

This workflow creates no ZIP and performs no publication. Do not commit, push, tag, publish, or run a full release build unless separately requested.
